/**
 * Record which sources a stored build was made from, so a build missing one
 * can be refused rather than overwriting a complete store. The fingerprint
 * cannot answer this: it covers only the sources that were available, and a
 * replica missing one simply produces a different fingerprint.
 *
 * Existing rows default to `[]`. That reads as incomplete, so the first
 * replica with every source republishes once and records them.
